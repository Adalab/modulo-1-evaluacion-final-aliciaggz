# Final Exam Module 1 (Alicia Gallego)

Hello ! welcome to my repository for my final exam for module 1.

The purpose of the exam is to create a responsive website through the provided design. We are using the Adalab Starter Kit, which helps automatise steps in the process. The Adalab Web Starter Kit uses SASS, npm, node.js and Gulp in order to help automatise coding tasks.

The technical requirements are:

-Use Sass.
-Use flexbox and CSS Grid.
-Use media queries.
-Solve some interactions using transitions

In addition, some interactions had to be added:

1. The arrow button of the hero module should link to the section "3 Reasons To Purchase".

2. The arrow button in the footer should link to the top of the page

3. All footer links must go to https://adalab.es

4. On the button hover ("Go" and "3 Reasons To Purchase") must include a transition that
   we leave it to your choice (for example: color, size, etc.

5. BONUS: make a small animation on the footer button
